Natural language processing model for analyzing entity documentation and communications

Training requirements:

Utilize synthetic transaction data generated from known money laundering typologies
Incorporate labeled datasets from financial crime databases
Implement federated learning techniques to learn from multiple financial institutions while preserving data privacy
Employ transfer learning from existing financial crime models
Implement continuous learning with human feedback loops for flagged transactions

2. Data Integration Architecture
Create secure connections to:

Banking core systems via encrypted API channels
Other blockchain networks via cross-chain oracles

Company registries across multiple jurisdictions
Ultimate beneficial ownership (UBO) databases
Sanctions and politically exposed persons (PEP) lists
News and media sources for adverse mentions
Trade finance documentation systems
Real estate transaction databases
High-value asset registries (art, luxury goods, etc.)

3. On-Chain Identity Framework
Implement:

Smart structuring detection (transactions designed to avoid reporting thresholds)
Trade-based money laundering identification through price variance analysis
Round-trip transaction detection (funds that circulate through multiple entities)
Shell company identification using multi-factor analysis
Layering detection across financial systems and asset classes
Integration techniques (final stage money laundering where funds re-enter legitimate economy)
Correspondent banking risk analysis
Crypto mixing and tumbling service usage detection
Smart contract analysis for DeFi-based laundering
Cross-border transaction monitoring with jurisdictional risk weighting

Regulatory reporting canisters customized by jurisdiction
Administrative canisters for system governance
Update protocols for evolving regulatory requirements
Threshold signature schemes for sensitive operations
Cycle management for sustainable operation
Chain-key cryptography for secure cross-canister communication

6. Governance and Compliance Framework
Establish:

Rule-based compliance engine with jurisdiction-specific parameters
Regulatory reporting mechanisms compatible with global standards
Suspicious activity report (SAR) generation and submission
Evidence preservation protocols for investigation support
Audit trail mechanisms for all system activities
User permission hierarchy with role-based access controls
Multi-signature approval workflows for high-risk cases
Regular compliance certification processes
Version control for regulatory requirement updates

7. Privacy and Security Features
Implement:

Homomorphic encryption for analyzing encrypted data
Secure multi-party computation for cross-institution analysis
Zero-knowledge compliance proofs for regulatory verification
Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques
Data minimization and purpose limitation controls
Cryptographic access controls for sensitive information
Time-based data retention and deletion protocols
Tamper-evident audit logs
Cryptographic proof of compliance generation
Secure key management with threshold signatures
